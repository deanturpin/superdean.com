# PBWC: Society for the preservation, promotion and pure pleasure of watches

At risk of understatement: _watches transcend art, design, culture, history, jewelry, fashion, mechanics and physics; amongst other things._

Take it to the next level by repairing and servicing your own watches; but know this: the rabbit hole goes __deep__...
