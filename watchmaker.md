## Clean

At this point it can start to become quite expensive; not only for the machines but also the consumables that you probably can't sell on quite so easily. Be careful putting your pallet forks and balance wheel in solvent as it can dissolve the [shellac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac) that holds the pallet and roller jewels in place.

- Lighter fluid: readily available from a newsagent for £2.99
- [Renata Essence](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/renata-essence) hairspring degreaser£11.50 (standard)
- Basket 25mm Mini Watch Part Cleaning Basket Economy: get a few of these, you can spend quite a lot but I went economy and I don't know any better; but I prefer the little brass threaded ones
- Screw top jam jar, recycled and small, the shallower the better to get your bits out and not use lots of cleaning fluid

You can do a job with the above, however, ultrasonic cleaners like [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/) are a great way in. Not as efficient as a proper four-stage cleaning machine but very reasonably-priced and entertaining to use. You can also impressive your friends and relatives by cleaning jewellery and spectacles.

## Rebuild and lubricate

A very complicated business, but let's look at the key areas of interest.

- A light oil for the quickest moving parts ([Moebius Syntalube 9010](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-9010-syntalube)): outrageously expensive!
- A grease for the high-friction metal-on-metal components ([Moebius 8300](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-8300-all-purpose-favourite))
- Oiler, fine (Bergeon red) for the jewels
- Oiler, medium (Bergeon green) for the grease; go for the cheap oilers to start with

I realise that suggesting using only two viscosities will cause some people to spit out their tea/beer, but _you have to start somewhere_. Also, Donald de Carlo only talks about "watch oil" and "clock oil" in the above watchmaking bible, so there you go.

__Full disclosure__: I also dip my oilers straight into the jars, which is probably illegal in Switzerland.

### Various received wisdoms about oil

"If you need to do it cheaply you can just use 8000 and DX, as it's a non synthetic it'll just mean the service intervals will be shorter. It’s not ideal because Moebius 8000 is a natural oil so that’s means velocity is not as high as synthetic oil."

- Moebius 9010: fast wheels
- Moebius D5: slow wheels; e.g., arbor, cannon pinion, hour wheel, minute wheel
- Moebius 9415: pallet fork jewels
- Moebius 9501, DX: keyless works
- Moebius 8217: for inside barrel wall (getting serious!)

## Timegraphers

A Timegrapher is the go-to tool for the job and at the low end they are surprisingly inexpensive. But you can get some useful results from a phone app; use with an earbud mic if you're not in a completely quiet environment.

## Mainspring winders

You can fix a lot by replacing parts rather than making new ones. But I think mainspring winders are the first step into it becoming serious. This _can_ be done by hand but people will get very cross about it if they find out.

## Tweezers

You can spend quite a bit on wood-tipped tweezers, and while they do give you a little more ping protection and safety handling dials, you're still going to need metal ones for fine work. So I think they're a complementary addition to your toolbox rather then essential (certainly for a beginner.)
