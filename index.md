# PBWC: Society for the preservation, promotion and pure pleasure of watches

At risk of understatement: _watches transcend art, design, culture, history, jewelry, fashion, mechanics and physics; amongst other things._

For ethusiasts who haven't yet accepted their calling, head over to the [collectors' page](collector.md). Otherwise, please continue and also see [watchmaker's resources](watchmaker.md).

## Tools

There are myriad tools that can streamline your workflow; I've listed them in order so you can add more as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily if you've gone far enough to scratch the itch.

[tldr: expect to fork out £500 to service a basic watch.]

See the [full spreadsheet](tools.xlsx).

### Inspect

You don't need much to get started -- you're basically just having a closer look -- but I often go out with a loupe in my jacket pocket.

- Eyeglass/loupe 2.8x (Bergeon 4422-3.5) -- note the Bergeon name is the focal length not the magnification
- Large cleaning cloth (Selvyt Medium White Size: Size A 25x25cm)

### Maintain

Next you might want to replace straps and maybe do a little cleaning and light buffing.

- Spring Bar Tool (Bergeon 6767-F Watch)
- Polywatch -- acrylic crystal polish
- Polishing Buff (Bergeon 2290)

### Explore

Now we're cooking: get the back off and inspect the insides for any issues.

- Rubber Case Ball (Bergeon 8008) -- squishy ball case back remover that works far better than you might think
- Case knife -- pen knife style
- Case knife -- oyster shucker style; I generally prefer these to the pen knife style but it's good to have a choice
- Rodico Premium (Bergeon 7033-1) -- for picking up dust and small components; particularly useful for manipulating hands
- Eyeglass/loupe 4x (Bergeon 4422-2.5) -- slightly more magnification
- Eyeglass Holder (AF 176.530.24) -- the ones that clip on your glasses look nice but are much more expensive
- Case Cushion (Bergeon Gel Ø75mm) -- treat yourself to a decent, large gel cushion

### Strip down

This is getting serious... and you'll need quite a few more tools. But you will have enough to completely dismantle a _basic_ movement. Note we are replacing broken parts at this level, rather than making new ones (which is a whole other level).

Always use the correct size screwdriver: you just risk chewing up the blades,
screw head or both.

- Movement Holder, Gents Size, Carbon Fibre (Bergeon 4040-P) -- essential and even the Bergeon ones are reasonably-priced
- Tweezers (Idealtek Anti-Magnetic No. 7 Very Fine, Curved Tips) -- I actually got a job lot of tweezers on eBay but these curved tipped ones are my favourite
- Latex ESD Finger Protection Thimble Cots Medium, Pack Of 144 (Bergeon 7968-18)
- Materials box / cloche -- you can never have enough
- Screwdriver with blades white 0.6mm (Bergeon 30080)
- Screwdriver with Blades yellow 0.8mm
- Screwdriver with Blades red 1.2mm
- Screwdriver with Blades pink 1.6mm
- Dial protector (Bergeon 6938) -- very cheap, or use the traditional "ripped baggy" (or both)
- Hand Levers, 3.0mm Tips (Bergeon 5431) -- £40... buying these hurt! I also got some cheap ones from eBay for a 10th of the price
- Hand Pusher, Red Ø0.80 - Grey Ø1.50mm (Bergeon 7404-2) -- haven't needed any other size so far but fitting hands is still a little hit-and-miss for me
- Cannon pinion remover -- can be very expensive for such a niche tool; alternatively do it carefully in a bag with tweezers (I found some blunt end brass ones that work, pull upwards to avoid bending anything)
- Plastic pointy stick/peg wood -- Starbucks call them "coffee stirrers" but they look like peg wood to me
- Barrel press -- eBay £5, if it's good enough for Marshall...
- Crystal press -- eBay £15.99, screw down seems a bit more controlled; I also padded the lower dies out with sticky felt furniture pads into a domed shaped

### Clean

At this point it can start to become quite expensive; not only for the machines but also the consumables that you probably can't sell on quite so easily.

Be careful putting your pallet forks and balance wheel in solvent as it can dissolve the [shellac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac) that holds the pallet and roller jewels in place.

- Lighter fluid -- readily available from a newsagent for £2.99
- [Renata Essence](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/renata-essence) hairspring degreaser-- £11.50
- Basket 25mm Mini Watch Part Cleaning Basket Economy -- get a few of these, you can spend quite a lot but I went economy and I don't know any better; but I prefer the little brass threaded ones
- Screw top jam jar -- recycled and small, the shallower the better to get your bits out and not use loads of cleaner

You can do a job with the above, however, ultrasonic cleaners like [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/) are a great way in. Not as efficient as a proper four-stage cleaning machine but very reasonably-priced and entertaining to use. You can also impressive your relatives cleaning jewellry and spectacles.

### Rebuild and lubricate

A very complicated business, but to get started you need:

- Light oil for the quickest moving parts ([Moebius Syntalube 9010](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-9010-syntalube)) -- outrageously expensive!
- Grease for the high-friction metal-on-metal components ([Moebius 8300](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-8300-all-purpose-favourite))
- Oiler, fine (Bergeon red) -- for the jewels
- Oiler, medium (Bergeon green) -- for the grease; go for the cheap oilers to start with

I realise that suggesting using only two viscosities will cause some people to spit out their tea/beer, but _you have to start somewhere_. Also, Donald de Carlo only talks about "watch oil" and "clock oil" in the above watchmaking bible, so there you go.

__Full disclosure__: I also dip my oilers straight into the jars, which is probably illegal in Switzerland.

#### Various received wisdoms

"If you need to do it cheaply you can just use 8000 and DX, as it's a non synthetic it'll just mean the service intervals will be shorter. It’s not ideal because Moebius 8000 is a natural oil so that’s means velocity is not as high as synthetic oil."

- Moebius 9010: fast wheels
- Moebius D5: slow wheels; e.g., arbor, cannon pinion, hour wheel, minute wheel
- Moebius 9415: pallet fork jewels
- Moebius 9501, DX: keyless works
- Moebius 8217: for inside barrel wall (getting serious!)

## The next level

### Timegraphers

A Timegrapher is the go-to tool for the job and at the low end they are surprisingly inexpensive. But you can get some useful results from a phone app; use with an earbud mic if you're not in a completely quiet environment.

### Mainspring winders

You can fix a lot by replacing parts rather than making new ones. But I think mainspring winders are the first step into it becoming serious. This _can_ be done by hand -- I have done a couple of times -- but people will get very cross about it.
