## Seiko 5 Sport

Rugged tool watches that will probably never see any water let alone 100m of it.

## Tissot

An unusually affordable Swiss automatic. Doesn't look much from the back; but of course, you get what you don't pay for.

## Forge and Foster

Jamming on the high-end Hublot "porthole" aestetic. Inexpensive but perfectly reliable chinese movements.

The vintage section... you can get some really good value if you're prepared to go old-school. They may not work as well as a brand new watch but they have a charm that you won't find straight out of the box. You can go really cheap with pin-lever but I think you need to be looking at minimum 15-jewels.
