# Current repairs

What's on the bench at the moment?

## ST3600 build

The ST3600 is an inexpensive but nice-looking ETA 6497 clone. I bought the movement, case, dial and hands separately on eBay. Make sure to buy a 37mm dial and not 38.9mm (which I bought first), and also the dial needs to be for the 6497 with the sub-dial at 9 o'clock, not for the 6498 with central seconds hand (which I also bought in my haste.)

You can but the whole build and minimal tools for not too much over Â£100.

### Tools

So you don't need many tools for this build... in theory. But I ended up dropping a case clamp into the movement and having to strip it down to retrieve it. And I did this twice! So, with a bit of luck you'll only need the following:

#### Not to be skimped on (Swiss)

- Tweezers, fine (e.g., Idealtek No. 7)
- Bergeon eye glass
- Bergeon squishy ball
- Bergeon screwdriver, red
- Bergeon screwdriver, pink
- Bergeon hand pushers, red/grey
- Rodico

#### Can be skimped on (eBay)

- Case cushion
- Nippers or side-cutters, to trim the stem
- Needle file, to file the threads after cutting the stem (may not be required, some fine sandpaper will probably do)
- Finger cots, large (but if this is your first build these will make it harder)
- Cloche (not essential as you'll have some little containers from the hands and dial, but nice to have)

### Notes

Whilst on paper this is a simple build, the case clamps are particularly fiddly and need to be fitted with the movement in the case (unlike a vintage Omega 601, for instance, which can be swung out of the way.) With the movement in the case, really get in with the loupe to understand where the lip of the case is; you can press the movement gently into the case to make a little space for the clamp. And with a bit of luck you'll get the screw in.

Once the balance is spinning, tighten the clamps and make sure it doesn't stop with pressure from compressing the dial.

There is talk of these movements coming out of the factory unlubricated, but that's a whole different story, see [watchmaker resources](watchmaker.md) for an introduction to oiling.

## Raketa 2609.HA 11.5''' (ready to sell)

crown very worn, can _just_ see the Omega logo, stem not engaging, rotor a
little worn.

## Molnija 3602

Serial 595600. Marriage watch using new case from eBay. It's actually a regular wear even though it still needs a bit of work: notably the hour and minute hands are new and silver but the seconds hand it didn't fit so it still has a chipped black paint one.

- [ ] Clean dial
- [ ] Ultrasonic case
- [ ] Service

## Cauny small dress watch with sub-seconds

- [ ] Service
- [ ] Replace main spring (gets very low amplitude on a low wind)
- [ ] Bezel has a gap
- [ ] Grease gasket

## Longines 12.92 12'''

Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm movement, 26mm dial. I found a 16-jewel
version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one
good one out of the two. Might've been easier to just to stick the good balance
in the 16-jewel, but it seems both balances are a little wobbly. Will service
and try again.

case](https://www.vintage-wristwatches.co.uk/watches-catalogue/archived-watches/longines-watch-archive/1930-9ct-gold-cushion-vintage-longines-watch-retailed-by-j-w-benson-4359/). But on the lookout for any usable pin-set case.

Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm. Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I went for a 30.4mm crystal and it was a success.
