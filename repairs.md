## Cauny small dress watch with sub-seconds

## Omega 131.019 (steel)

22M serial (1965), cal 601 non-runner, arrived in a case for an automatic, has
some homemade case clamps.

- [x] Buy correct NOS case for movement
- [x] New mainspring  
- [x] Order new 30.8mm crystal
- [x] Fit new crystal
- [x] Ultrasonic clean of keyless works
- [x] Trial fit brand new seconds hand (could be too shiny compared to old hands) -- looks fine
- [x] Stem doesn't engage properly, decase and investigate -- it's the wrong crown for the case!
- [x] Try correct stem/crown -- winding very stiff, hmmm
- [x] Trial with correct stem outside of the case -- doesn't fit
- [x] Order new case clamps -- see [Omega case clamps](https://www.cousinsuk.com/PDF/categories/8427_Omega%20Case%20Clamps.pdf)
- [x] Order new stem and crown (from Cousins)
- [ ] Try oiling the jewels, only achieving approx. 170&deg; amplitude

### Stems

- [Omega](https://gleave.london/stem-omega-480-1106/)
- [Generic](https://www.cousinsuk.com/sku/details/omega-generic-movement-parts/ome6001106g)

- [ ] Replace main spring (gets very low amplitude on a low wind)
- [ ] Bezel has a gap

## Longines 12.92 12'''

Hands a little fragile, no case, 27.8mm movement, 26mm dial. I found a 16-jewel
version with a wobbly balance to use as a donor, so basically I'll make one
good one out of the two. Might've been easier to just to stick the good balance
in the 16-jewel, but it seems both balances are a little wobbly. Will service
and try again.

Probably should be in a [gold
case](https://www.vintage-wristwatches.co.uk/watches-catalogue/archived-watches/longines-watch-archive/1930-9ct-gold-cushion-vintage-longines-watch-retailed-by-j-w-benson-4359/). But on the lookout for any usable pin-set case.

### 15-jewel

Serial 4929243 (1930).

- [ ] Find new case

## 1916 Borgel trench watch 13'''

Marvin 362, 29.5mm; bezel &#x2300; 30.2mm. Bezel measured thrice: 30.17, 30.21, 30.24. So I went for a 30.4mm crystal and it was a success.

- [x] Order 30.4mm crystal
- [x] Polish silver
- [x] Replace crystal
- [x] Order donor movement for practice/spares
- [ ] Rachet wheel is missing a tooth, still works but might replace from donor for completeness

- [ ] Grease threads on case

## Fortis FHF ST-96 11.5'''

- [ ] Order new crystal -- opening measures 30.96mm
- [ ] Review missing case screws
- [ ] Measure timing

## Molnija 3602/3 marriage watch 16'''

So I've ended up with quite of few of these now! The latest is a 3603 with anitshock.

I started out just trying to fix a pocket watch using another as a donor, but I
managed to break both balances so I bought a third one to build the marriage
watch. The others I'll sell or use as spares.

### Serial 587360

3603, balance is trying to start after a toot from the blower, looks like it wobbles but no obvious side shake (so pivots probably intact); keyless works/stem aren't engaging.

- [ ] Inspect keyless works
- [ ] Service

### Serial 445602

Trying to start, sounds very unbalanced (triplets) but actually looks OK. Pallet fork could be gummed up.

- [ ] Service

### Serial 998652

Awesome forest scene case, broken fourth wheel.

- [x] Measure bezel: 42.6mm 
- [x] Replace fourth wheel
- [x] Fit ratchet wheel screw
- [x] Order new 42.8mm crystal (next largest I could find)
- [ ] Fit new crystal -- crystal press not large enough!
- [ ] Fit working balance
- [ ] New hands
- [ ] New dial

### Serial 594243

Broken balance, good hands, case much newer but not as nice as the wolf one, full hunter, pallet bridge has crazy big screws in it, ran overnight after swapping in a good balance (but only in dial down position).

- [x] Reseat click
- [ ] Find correct pallet fork bridge screws

### Serial 595600

Marriage watch with case from eBay, regular wear even though it needs a bit of work still.

- [x] Order NOS watch case
- [x] Fit movement
- [x] Fit silver hands -- seconds hand too tight, refitted original black
- [ ] Trim stem
- [ ] Fit correct silver seconds hand
