## NH35A build (27 September 2023)

This is my first NH35A build. I just wanted to get a feel for it given the abundance of mod kits for these Seiko movements.

£60 for the parts, probably the same again on tools.

- [Clear diver case](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/175384131933)
- [NH35A](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/374352507306)
- [Gold dial](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/125386605361?var=426399896939)
- [Gold hands](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/354891209789?var=624196900074)

Initially I was confused by the dial feet spacing so I removed the plastic movement spacer. _Do not do this!_ Unless you want to disassemble the calendar works to get it back on again. However, having done this, I was surprised to discover how many plastic components are in there.

The dial comes with extra feet for other movements, but these can simply be twisted off with an old pair of blunt tweezers. This does leave little nubs that will stop the dial laying flat but the dial is soft and they can quickly be ground off with sandpaper. The feet you need to remove are those with the smallest gap between them.

I have to say, this movement does feel a little cheap compared to an ST3600, say, but it is also pretty rugged. I actually thought I'd broken it putting the dial side back together and then didn't follow the usual precautions: subsequently lost an index and bent a hand... but when I realised what I'd done I popped the cots back on and continued properly! (I'd fitted one of those plastic wheels _upside down_ so you couldn't adjust the hands.) Finally, you don't need the extra movement spacer that came with the case, nor does this movement require a dial washer.

In conclusion: this case looks cool but it feels very poor quality: the bezel tolerance is particularly bad. But it was a fun little project that will stay in the collection.

### Tools

If I hadn't cocked up the spacer I wouldn't have needed a screwdriver at all. (I used a Bergeon 30080 screwdriver, red (1.2mm) to remove the calendar works... although it might actually be a 1.4mm.)

#### Not to be skimped on (Swiss)

- Tweezers (you don't need these expensive ones for this job, but they are Dumoxel Non Magnetic Tweezers with Boxwood Tips)
- Bergeon 4422-2.5 eye glass
- Bergeon 8008 squishy ball
- Bergeon 7033-1 Rodico

#### Can be skimped on (eBay)

- Blunt tweezers, to remove the extra dial feet and hold the square section of the stem (these are brass from a job lot)
- Finger cots (I use large Bergeon 7968-18)
- Hand pushers (Hand Fitting Tool Set, Deluxe from CousinsUK)
- Pointy stick, to release the stem
- Eye glass wire
- Sharpie, to mark the stem
- Nippers or side-cutters, to cut the stem to size
- 600 grit sandpaper, to clean up the stem and remove the extra dial feet

#### Nice to have

- Case cushion (slightly contentious but you _could_ get away with just a cloth)
- Hand levers (assuming you don't get it right first time)
- Baggy, to protect the dial when removing the hands
- Blower
- Polishing buff or needle file, to refine the stem after cutting (this is a Bergeon 2290)

## ST3600 (28 August 2023)

_Disclaimer: any resemblance to watches real or imagined is entirely intentional._

![ST3600 front](st3600_front.jpg)

You can fund the whole build and tools for not too much over £100.

The ST3600 is an inexpensive but nice-looking ETA 6497 clone. I bought the movement, case, dial and hands separately on eBay. Make sure to buy a 37mm dial and not 38.9mm (which I bought first in error but still used the hands.)

See [6497 on Ranfft](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&Unitas_6497).

- 16.5''', Dm= 36.6mm, Do= 37.2mm
- H= 4.2mm
- F= 0.5mm
- T= 1.85mm
- 15/17 jewels
- f = 18000 A/h
- power reserve 50h
- Hands 2.00 x 1.15 / 0.27mm

- [Dial](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/185468300563?var=693275967599)

### Tools

You don't need many tools for this build... in theory. But I ended up dropping a case clamp into the movement and doing a complete disassembly to retrieve it. And I did this twice! So, if all goes well, here's the minimum set of tools required:

![ST3600 tools](st3600_tools.jpg)

#### Not to be skimped on (Swiss)

- Idealtek anti-magnetic number 7 very fine, curved tips
- Bergeon 4422-2.5 eye glass
- Bergeon 8008 squishy ball
- Bergeon 30080 screwdriver, red (1.2mm)
- Bergeon 30080 screwdriver, pink (1.6mm)
- Bergeon 7033-1 Rodico

#### Can be skimped on (eBay)

- Eye glass wire
- Case cushion
- Sharpie, to mark the stem
- Nippers or side-cutters, to cut the stem to size
- Polishing buff or needle file, to tidy up the stem after cutting (this is a Bergeon 2290)
- Finger cots, large (these are Bergeon 7968-18)
- Hand pushers (I only used the 2mm one)
- Cloche (inexpensive, but you could just use the containers from the hands and dial)

### Notes

Whilst on paper this is a simple build, the case clamps are particularly fiddly and need to be fitted with the movement in the case (unlike a vintage Omega 601, for instance, which can be swung out of the way.) With the movement in the case, really get in with the loupe to understand where the lip of the case is; you can press the movement gently into the case to make a little space for the clamp. And with a bit of luck you'll get the screw in.

Once the balance is spinning, tighten the clamps and make sure it doesn't stop with pressure from compressing the dial.

There is talk of these movements coming out of the factory unlubricated, but that's a whole different story, see [watchmaker resources](watchmaker.md) for an introduction to oiling.

## Omega 131.019 gold-plated (sold)

30463681 (1970), cal 601, worn crown, 43-hour power reserve, crystal is loose,

## Rone 34mm FHF ST-96 11.5''' (donated to fellow watchmaker)

I think this might be my rite of passage.

Bought for 25 bucks four months ago, and it _just_ had a slippy mainspring. So,
I attempted a service and immediately the cannon pinion evaporated. Ordered a
donor and broke _two_ escape wheel pinions on the rebuild. OK, ordered a second
doner. When that arrived I serviced the keyless works and sent the yoke spring
into orbit. No worries, I have another... also sent that one to the Moon. But
wait... I found the first on my pants! Right, on the home stretch, located the
case and movement spacer from months previous and it's back together, looking
exactly like it did when I bought it! But I have grown as a human being.

## Accurist Shockmaster (sold)

Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

- [x] Add crocodile leather strap

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate" (returned to customer)

- [x] Replace coil, hands very difficult to remove
