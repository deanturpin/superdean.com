## Rone 34mm FHF ST-96 11.5''' (donated to fellow watchmaker)

I think this might be my rite of passage.

Bought for 25 bucks four months ago, and it _just_ had a slippy mainspring. So,
I attempted a service and immediately the cannon pinion evaporated. Ordered a
donor and broke _two_ escape wheel pinions on the rebuild. OK, ordered a second
doner. When that arrived I serviced the keyless works and sent the yoke spring
into orbit. No worries, I have another... also sent that one to the Moon. But
wait... I found the first on my pants! Right, on the home stretch, located the
case and movement spacer from months previous and it's back together, looking
exactly like it did when I bought it! But I have grown as a human being.

## Accurist Shockmaster (sold)

Hand winder G10, keeps great time, 34-hour power reserve.

- [x] Buff case
- [x] Add crocodile leather strap

## Mr. Jones "The Accurate" (returned to customer)

An actual quartz repair!

£145 RRP -- see [website](https://mrjoneswatches.com/products/the-accurate) --
which is quite surprising given I bought a whole new movement _with_ battery
for £9.

- [x] Replace battery -- still not running
- [x] Ordered new Ronda 513
- [x] Replace coil, hands very difficult to remove
