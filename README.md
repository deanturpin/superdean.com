## Getting on the Rolex waiting list
- Meet with multiple dealers
- Some value purchase history, some value relationships
- Set up appointments and multiple ADs and assess which store is best
- Work your way up
- Only buy what you love, don't fall for dealer tricks
- Grow the relationship, be the person they want to call
