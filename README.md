# Watchmaking
Take it to the next level by repairing and servicing your own watches; but be
warned: the rabbit hole goes __deep__...

## Tools
There are myriad tools that can streamline your workflow; I've listed them in
order so you can add more as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily
if you've gone far enough to scratch the itch.

Always use the correct size screwdriver. You just risk chewing up the blades,
screw head or both.

![tools.png](tools.png)

See the [full spreadsheet](tools.xlsx).

### Inspect
You don't need much to get started and just having a close look.

- Eyeglass, Black No. 3.5 = 2.8x (Bergeon 4422-3.5)
- Selvyt Medium (PR) Cloth, White

### Maintain
Next you might want to replace straps with some surface cleaning and buffing.

- Spring bar tool (kit)
- Polywatch (cleaning acrylic crystals)
- Pin pusher (adjusting bracelets)
- Bergeon 2290 Polishing Buff

### Explore
Now we're cooking: get the back off and have a look on the inside for any issues.

- Squishy ball case back remover
- Case knife (pen knife) (kit)
- Case knife (oyster shucker style) (kit)
- Rodico Premium (Bergeon 7033-1)
- Eyeglass, Black No. 2.5 = 4x (Bergeon 4422-2.5)
- AF 176.530.24 Headband Eyeglass Holder
- Case Cushion Watch Black Gel Ø75mm Bergeon 5395-75-N - HC5395-75-N (HC5395-75-N) 

### Strip down
This is getting serious... and you'll need quite a few more tools. But you
should have enough to complete dismantle a basic movement. Note we are
replacing broken parts at this level, rather than making new ones.

- Materials box / cloche
- Movement holder
- Bergeon 30080 screwdriver with blades (white 0.6mm)
- Bergeon 30080 screwdrivers with Blades (yellow 0.8mm)
- Bergeon 30080 Screwdrivers with Blades (red 1.2mm)
- Screwdriver Ø1.60mm Bergeon 30080-H - HS1416 (HS1416) 
- Dial protector
- Bergeon hand levers (£40!)
- Hand levers (cheap eBay)
- Bergeon 7404-2 hand pusher (red 0.8mm / grey 1.5mm) -- haven't needed any other size so far!
- Crown pinion remover (can be very expensive for such a specific tool)
- \#2 tweezers
- Plastic pointy stick / peg wood
- Barrel press (cheap) £5

### Clean
At this point it can start to become quite expensive; not only in the machines
but consumables that you probably can't sell on quite as easily.

However, ultrasonic cleaners like [this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/)
are a good way in. Not as efficient as a proper cleaner but very
reasonably-priced and cool to use.

Be careful putting your pallet forks in solvent as it can disolve the shellac
that holds the pallet jewels in place.

- Lighter fluid (readily available from a newsagent £2.99)
- Renata essence £8

### Rebuild and lubricate
A very complicated business, but to get started you need:

- A light oil for the quickest moving parts (jewels)
- A grease on the high-friction metal-on-metal components

### Regulate
A Timegrapher is go-to tool for the job and at the low end they are
surprisingly inexpensive. But you can get useful results from a phone app with
an earbud mic.
