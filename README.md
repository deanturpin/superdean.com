# Watchmaking
Take it to the next level by repairing and servicing your own watches; but be
warned: the rabbit hole goes __deep__...

## Tools
There are myriad tools that can streamline your workflow; I've listed them in
order so you can add as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily if
you've gone far enough to scratch the itch.

Always to use the correct size screwdriver. You just risk chewing up the
blades, screw head or both.

### Servicing
Servicing usually goes hand-in-hand with the strip-down and repair but it can
also start to become quite expensive; not only in the machines but consumables
that you probably can't sell on quite as easily.

But do consider an ultrasonic cleaner, like [this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/).
Very reasonably-priced and cool to use.

### Degreaser
Be careful putting your pallet forks in solvent as it can disolve the shellac
that holds the pallet jewels in place.

- Lighter fluid (readily available from a newsagent £2.99)
- Renata essence £8

### Lubrication
A very complicated business, but basically you need:
- A light oil for the quickest moving parts (jewels)
- A slightly heavier oil for the metal-on-metal parts
- And a grease on the high-friction components (e.g., keyless works)
