- Set up appointments and multiple ADs and assess which store is best
- Work your way up
- Only buy what you love, don't fall for dealer tricks
- Grow the relationship, be the person they want to call

# Watchmaking
Take it to the next level by repairing and servicing your own watches; but know

## Tools
There are myriad tools that can streamline your workflow; I've listed them in
order so you can add more as you progress. And tools can be resold quite easily
if you've gone far enough to scratch the itch.

![tools.png](tools.png)

See the [original spreadsheet](tools.xlsx).

### Inspect
You don't need much to get started, basically just having a closer look.

- Eyeglass, Black No. 3.5 = 2.8x (Bergeon 4422-3.5)
- Selvyt Medium (PR) Cloth, White Size: Size A 25x25cm

### Maintain
Next you might want to replace straps and maybe a little cleaning and light
buffing.

- Bergeon 6767-F Watch Spring Bar Tool - Long
- Polywatch -- acrylic crystal polish
- Bergeon 2290 Polishing Buff

### Explore
Now we're cooking: get the back off and inspect the insides for any issues.

- Bergeon 8008, Rubber Case Ball -- squishy ball case back remover that works
  far better than you might expect
- Case knife -- pen knife style
- Case knife -- oyster shucker style; I generally prefer these to the other
  one, but it's good to have a choice for tricky cases
- Rodico Premium (Bergeon 7033-1)
- Eyeglass, Black No. 2.5 = 4x (Bergeon 4422-2.5)
- AF 176.530.24 Headband Eyeglass Holder -- the ones that clip on your glasses
  look nice but are much more expensive
- Case Cushion Watch Black Gel Ø75mm Bergeon -- treat yourself to a good gel
  cushion

### Strip down
This is getting serious... and you'll need quite a few more tools. But you
should have enough to completely dismantle a _basic_ movement. Note we are
replacing broken parts at this level, rather than making new ones.

Always use the correct size screwdriver. You just risk chewing up the blades,
screw head or both.

- Movement Holder, Gents Size, Carbon Fibre (Bergeon 4040-P) -- essential and
  even the Bergeon ones are reasonably-priced
- Tweezers, Idealtek Anti-Magnetic No. 7 Very Fine, Curved Tips -- I actually
  got a job lot of tweezers on eBay but these curved tipped ones are my
favourite
- Latex ESD Finger Protection Thimble Cots Medium (Pack Of 144) Bergeon 7968-18
- Materials box / cloche -- you can never have enough
- Bergeon 30080 screwdriver with blades (white 0.6mm)
- Bergeon 30080 screwdriver with Blades (yellow 0.8mm)
- Bergeon 30080 Screwdriver with Blades (red 1.2mm)
- Bergeon 30080 Screwdriver with Blades (pink 1.6mm)
- Dial protector -- or use the traditional "ripped baggy" (or both)
- Hand Levers, 3.0mm Tips (Bergeon 5431) -- £40... buying these hurt! I've also
  got some cheap ones from eBay for a 10th of the price
- Hand Pusher, Red Ø0.80 - Grey Ø1.50mm (Bergeon 7404-2) -- haven't needed any
  other size so far but fitting hands is still a little hit-and-miss for me
- Crown pinion remover -- can be very expensive for such a niche tool;
  alternatively do it carefully in a bag with tweezers (I found some blunt
brass ones that work, pull upwards to avoid bending anything)
- Plastic pointy stick / peg wood -- Starbucks call them "coffee stirrers" but
  they look like peg wood to me
- Barrel press -- eBay £5, if it's good enough for Marshall...
- Crystal press -- eBay £15.99, screw down seems a bit more controlled; I also
  padded the lower dies out with sticky felt furniture pads into a domed shaped

### Clean
At this point it can start to become quite expensive; not only for the machines
but also the consumables that you probably can't sell on quite so easily.

However, ultrasonic cleaners like [this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DK-SONIC-Household-Ultrasonic-Eyeglasses/dp/B08S6V52MV/)
are a good way in. Not as efficient as a proper four-stage cleaning machine but
very reasonably-priced and entertaining to use.

Be careful putting your pallet forks in solvent as it can dissolve the shellac
that holds the pallet jewels in place.

- Lighter fluid -- readily available from a newsagent for £2.99
- Renata essence -- £8
- Basket 25mm Mini Watch Part Cleaning Basket Economy -- get a few of these,
  you can spend quite a lot but I went economy and I don't know any better

### Rebuild and lubricate
A very complicated business, but to get started you need:

- A light oil for the quickest moving parts -- [Moebius Syntalube 9010](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-9010-syntalube), outrageously expensive!
- A grease for the high-friction metal-on-metal components -- [Moebius 8300](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/moebius-8300-all-purpose-favourite)
- Bergeon fine oiler (red) -- for the jewels
- Bergeon medium oiler (green) -- for the grease; go for the cheap ones to start with

I realise that suggesting using only two viscosities will cause some people to
spit out their tea/beer, but _you have to start somewhere_. Also, Donald de Carlo
only talks about "watch oil" and "clock oil" in the above book so there you go.

Full disclosure: I also dip my oilers straight into the jars, which is probably
illegal in Switzerland.

### Regulate
A Timegrapher is the go-to tool for the job and at the low end they are
surprisingly inexpensive. But you can get some useful results from a phone app;
use with an earbud mic if you're not in a completely quiet environment.
