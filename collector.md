## Getting on the Rolex waiting list

See [this article](https://www.vulcanwatchstraps.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-rolex-waiting-list).

- Meet with multiple dealers
- Some value purchase history, some value relationships
- Set up appointments and multiple ADs and assess which store is best
- Work your way up
- Only buy what you love, don't fall for dealer tricks
- Grow the relationship, be the person they want to call

## Setting the date safely

Move the hands to 6 o'clock, change the date to the day _before_ today, and then move the time forward to get the correct half of the day. Never fiddle with the date between 9pm and 4am; _but_, if it has a [phantom date](https://calibercorner.com/phantom-date/) then good luck!
